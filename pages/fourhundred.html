                <h2 class="t4 gen_header">Historical Context</h2>
                <h3 class="t3 gen_header">The New Warring States Period</h3>
                <p class="t1 gen_text">In the year 2029, the Russian State collapsed under the death of its leader. As the floundering Ukraine campaign's horror came to light, the general population rebelled agressively. Peace keepers from the UN tried their best to interviene, but no amount of dilligance after-the-fact could recreate critical records and infrastructure extremely necessary to hold a country so divided together. What happened next was commonly referred to as the "New Warring States Period". Starting initially in what was formally Russia and spreading to most superpowers, general societal collapse propelled from a multiple socio-economic factors plunged the world into utter chaos, but at the county level.</p>
                <p class="t1 gen_text">Unlike the previous Warring States Period, and other periods of general unrest, Humanity had developed nuclear weapons. And with no major force preventing their use, hell on Earth became more than just a saying.</p>
                <p class="t1 gen_text">Or, at least it should have. Due to a general lack of maintanence and period of relative peace and disarment leading up to this period, the actual amount of successfull nuclear weaponry detonations were few and far between. And, in a completely ironic twist, managed to accomplish two things: a prevention of Climate Change due to excess greenhouse gas emmissions, and the birth of Magic.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="t3 gen_header">The New Moon Period</h3>
                <p class="t1 gen_text">With enough radiation in the air, mutations of unknown consiquence began to occur. First, only noticable in babies born after 2037, humanity began a rapid change from a unified species of minor diviation, to the trunk of a new form of evolution. The patterns of mutation seemed to at least structure humans into obvious new subspecies that were biologically similar but entirely viable on their own. As more subspecies of humans began to emerge, so too, did magic. Initially thought to be baseless internet rumors, actual "magic" began to appear usable by all species of hunamity. At first, the magic was extremely weak, but with each passing year, more and more powerful magic became usable. And with the power of the internet, widespread. Soon, the still-functioning governments that had just barely wrestled control back were facing a new threat that was even more difficult to supress. By 2159, the world was yet again plunged into chaos. This time period is referred to as the "New Moon Period", as the first major rebellion kicked off when an extremely powerful magician caused mass confusion for French state police by seemingly destroying the moon right as protestors broke through the gates of the Palais du Luxembourg.</p>
                <h3 class="t2 gen_header">The Year of the Second Son</h3>
                <p class="t1 gen_text">The "Year of the Second Son" is a period of time specifically referring to the time period of June 2162 - August 2163 in what was the Country of Sweeden. This time period is noted as the first instance of a successful re-estabished old-age government in which new societal changed were introduced to enforce equal rights between those with and without the ability to use magic. The period is named the "Year of the Second Son" as it was the second son of the pervious Prime Misiter who managed to re-establish the government and inact the societal changes. Unfortuately, a group of anarco-magi managed to completely destroy all governmental buildings at the first anniversery celebrations, and the government soon collapsed afterwards. The names of the Prime Minister and Son have been lost to history.</p>
                <h3 class="t2 gen_header">The Pink Panther Panic</h3>
                <p class="t1 gen_text">The "The Pink Panther Panic" occured in the northern regions of Canada in 2193. Due to rapid changes in ocean currents from the New Warring States Period, an extremely temporary land bridge connected some of the more outlying islands in the Northern Regions to the lower parts of the Hudson Bay from Spring 2172 to Spring 2185. In May of 2174, a gigantic pink colored Panther-esque creature was spotted on the land bridge approaching some of the settlements on the southern shores of the bay. The military was quickly dispatched to try and handle the situation, but could not seem to hit the gigantic creature. After 10 hours of battle, the panther disappeared. Teams were sent to the last known location of the panther only to discover a clearly exhausted pink Artic Hare. As the teams approached, a smaller version of the Pink Panther appeared before them. It was determined that the Artic Hare was able to cast illusion magic. This is the first recorded instance of a non-human creature using magic.</p>
                <p class="t1 gen_text">The Lost Decade was the time period between May 17th 2203 and October 3rd 2212. This period of time is notible due to the internet becoming disconnected and fragmented globally. Pockets of connectivity still existed, but global connectivity ended. This was the first time this occured, and due to a lack of stability, physical records are sparse during this time period. The Lost decade ended due to magicians reestablishing connectivity by blending old-age technology with magic.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="t3 gen_header">The Golden Age</h3>
                <p class="t1 gen_text">The Golden Age or First Golden Age of the New World was the period of time from October 3rd 2212 to April 24th 2357 in which global stability and interconnectivity was high. This was mainly due to the re-establishment of technologies from the old-age through the embuement of magic to replace high-level technologies and infrastructure lost in the New Warring States Period and New Moon Period. This era of humanity saw the establishment of governments and diplomatic ties, a rise in general well-being, and a deep development of magic.</p>
                <h3 class="t2 gen_header">The Druid</h3>
                <p class="t1 gen_text">The Druid is a historical figure that first appeard in 2231 in Hophana, what was the South West of the United States. The Druid was initially an ecologist magician who was working with locals to prevent water table collapse. During a cave dive, accidential exposure to a previously unknown fungi's spores caused a rapid mutation in the Druid's DNA, causing a destablization of their DNA and allowing them to change their own composition. The Druid underwent intensive gene therapy, but the spores from the fungi stablized internally, allowing the druid to access new forms of magic. The Druid's mutation became a sort of virus, spreading through the population, granting some individuals similar magic mutations, but being completely harmless in a majority of the population.</p>
                <h3 class="t2 gen_header">The Reestablishment of the Olympics</h3>
                <p class="t1 gen_text">In 2286, the Olympic Games of the old-age were reestablished in the Brusvii region of Grumm, what was roughly Central Europe. Representatives from all over the world were invited to compete in a modified set of the origional games and different classes were established based on sub-species and magic ability.</p>
                <h3 class="t2 gen_header">The Warlock of No</h3>
                <p class="t1 gen_text">The Warlock of No was a historical figure from the City of No in the Bonrain Region of Zeelai. Actual dates around this person's life are shrouded in mystery, as the fame they recieved was due mostly to successive reincarnation attempts that may or may not have succeeded. There is concrete evidence that the spirit of the Warlock or some essence of the Warlock was able to be tapped into by non-magic users to gain the ability to use magic.</p>
                <h3 class="t2 gen_header">The Sun King of the Golden Horde</h3>
                <p class="t1 gen_text">In 2357, a powerful magician named Franc Luis Du Parisi appeard in the western region of Parisi, a region in the northern parts of what was France. Said to be the culmination of generations of magicians, traicing their lineage directly to the New Moon magician, the magic abilities of Franc Luis Du Parisi far surpassed the capabilites of what most governmental magician cores could produce at the time. Claiming to have the right of rule based on influence-of-lineage, Franc Luis gathered a cult-like following in the Parisi region, amassing an army and eventually overthrowing the Government of Mon Franci. Establishing himself as the Sun King, Franc Luis launched a suprise invasion of neighboring countires in April 2357, leading to all out war on what was the European Continent.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="t3 gen_header">The Sun War and the Fall from Grace</h3>
                <h3 class="t2 gen_header">The Sun War</h3>
                <p class="t1 gen_text">The Golden Horde of the Sun King was not as well trained or as skilled as the Sun King, which created logistical issues for the war effort of the Sun King. However, the Sun King was able to quickly establish diplomatic ties with powerful governments to establish a better power base. This coalition was met by an allied front of smaller nations that were at risk of conquest geographically. Both sides were able to roughly field the same amount of troops, but due to the significant cultural differences of the allied smaller nations, infighting occured, leading to ineffective use of resources. This too became a problem for the Sun King and allies, especially by 2360, when most of the continent of Old Europe had been conquered and territory was being distributed. Massive infighting lead to a successful assasination attempt on the Sun King himself, throwing the entire war effort into disarray. The sudden shift in momentum allowed new splinter factions to rise and challenge governments for power and control, disrupting the war overall and creating what can only be describled as a massive power grab that eventually spread to all corners of the world.</p>
                <h3 class="t2 gen_header">The Fall from Grace</h3>
                <p class="t1 gen_text">General instablility lasted from roughly 2360 to roughly 2410. Though records of this era exist, most are of little consequence. The most significant occurance in this period of time was not what happened, but what the results were. Humanity faced a significant population collapse during the New Warring States period, the population has started to recover in the Golden Age, but again collapsed even more severly during the Fall from Grace. Aditionally, the general level of technology accessible to the average person rapidly decreased during the Fall from Grace, although magic skill on average increased rapidly.</p>
